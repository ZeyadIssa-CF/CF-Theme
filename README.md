# CF Theme

DESCRIPTION

This is an incredibly simple script to copy and paste all files in the mplstyle directory in here to the .matplotlib/stylelib one on your computer.
This should allow you to readily use the CF theme. It also means the code can potentially be repurposed to make a functioning thematic package.

INSTALLATION

To install the styles:
>> python setup.py -install

To upgrade them (i.e: when you already have a file named CF)
>> python setup.py -upgrade

Note: This script will not run if the .matplotlib/stylelib file is not present, so ensure that matplotlib is installed prior.

USAGE

Call on the mplstyle file as you would any style sheet by referencing its style name (i.e: cf)
