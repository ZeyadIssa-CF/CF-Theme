# CF Theme

DESCRIPTION

This is an incredibly simple script to copy and paste all files in the mplstyle directory in here to the .matplotlib/stylelib one on your computer.
This should allow you to readily use the CF theme. It also means the code can potentially be repurposed to make a functioning thematic package for rmd and such by someone who actually knows what they're doing.

INSTALLAITON

To install the styles:
>> python setup.py -install

To upgrade them (i.e: when you already have a file named CF)
>> python setup.py -upgrade

USAGE

Call on the mplstyle file as you would any style sheet by referencing its style name (i.e: cf)
